# Standalone

Standalone scripts are self-contained files that include all necessary dependencies within a single file. 

> [!NOTE]
> If your server uses many scripts from SkLibrary, try to avoid standalone scripts. <br>
> Standalone scripts can increase the chances of dependency conflicts and make integration more difficult.
